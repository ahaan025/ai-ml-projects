# ai-ml-projects

This repository is dedicated to the projects I make as I learn more about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. 

1. BART_Text_summarization: Implementing Transformer Neural architecture called BART to build a text summarization model. Typically, text summarization models would be built using convolutional neural networks. I built this project as an extension of my NLP summer research internship at UT Dallas under Associate Professor Chris Irwin Davis.
